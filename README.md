# Task 1

In order to successfully complete the exercises below, access to a working MySQL and PHP environment is required. We would
recommend installing WAMP (Windows) or LAMP (Linux) which includes the needed components for completing this assignment.
WAMP can be acquired from here: [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).

## Set up

Add necessary fields to .env, like:
- DB_HOST
- DB_NAME
- DB_USER
- DB_PASS

and etc.

I used [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) to manage the database.

Don't forget to execute

```
composer update
```

in the terminal.
